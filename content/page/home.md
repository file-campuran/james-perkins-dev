      - title: Bye bye Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS
        description: >-
          I am a power user of Chakra UI but lately, I have been checking out a
          new framework that is even better. This video covers all of this and
          more!

      - title: Create coding profiles using Visual Studio Code
        description: >
          This video shows you how to create multiple Visual Studio Code
          profiles.  I use this daily as it allows me to create content on
          multiple platforms, and also have a completely separate one for
          everything else.

          This video shows you how to add a cookie to hold on to whether the
          user is using light or dark mode. 


          This means when they come back to your site, they will have the same
          mode.

        description: >
          Warp Terminal has finally been released to public beta! It's probably
          the best experience that I use from a terminal. I use it everyday at
          work and on my MBP air!
