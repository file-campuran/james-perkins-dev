        description: >-
          The podcast isn't like most podcasts. I interview people in tech from
          developers to CEOs. Except instead of talking about work, we talk
          about what we do outside out of work!

          I use Twitch to cover fun and exciting content. Sometimes we work on
          projects, other times we check out new open-source projects.
