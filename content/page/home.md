        description: >-
          The podcast isn't like most podcasts. I interview people in tech from
          developers to CEOs. Except instead of talking about work, we talk
          about what we do outside out of work!

          Here we are, the new year is upon us, and if you are like me, you have
          set
            some New Yearâ€™s resolutions for yourself. Possibly learning a new language,
            skill or improving on the foundation that you have. What a better way to kick
            off the year then we with a crash course!
