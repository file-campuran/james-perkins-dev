          Here we are, the new year is upon us, and if you are like me, you have
          set
            some New Yearâ€™s resolutions for yourself. Possibly learning a new language,
            skill or improving on the foundation that you have. What a better way to kick
            off the year then we with a crash course!

        title: Dealing with Date objects in Next data fetching
        author: James Perkins
        category: tutorials
        description: >-
          When working with Data objects in ServerSideProps or StaticProps
          Next.js doesn't like it because they don't serailize it for
          performance. So you are on your own to handle it.

        description: >-
          The podcast isn't like most podcasts. I interview people in tech from
          developers to CEOs. Except instead of talking about work, we talk
          about what we do outside out of work!
