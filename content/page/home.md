      - title: Bye bye Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS
        description: >-
          I am a power user of Chakra UI but lately, I have been checking out a
          new framework that is even better. This video covers all of this and
          more!

      - title: Create coding profiles using Visual Studio Code
        description: >
          This video shows you how to create multiple Visual Studio Code
          profiles.  I use this daily as it allows me to create content on
          multiple platforms, and also have a completely separate one for
          everything else.

      - title: The Dark Side of Product Hunt... (But It's Still Legit)
        description: >-
          I launched my product on Product Hunt, and the experience was great...
          Except there is a dark side to Product Hunt that no one is talking
          bout. 


          This video talks about the Dark Side.

        description: >
          Warp Terminal has finally been released to public beta! It's probably
          the best experience that I use from a terminal. I use it everyday at
          work and on my MBP air!
