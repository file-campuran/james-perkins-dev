You may notice that if you scroll to the bottom of any blog post on my site, you will see a section that asks you if you like this post and if you do to give it some claps. This isn't something you see very often but it is easier than you think.

Personally, I chose to use Lyket, a great bit of indie development. It supports React, HTML and WordPress so perfect for all the cases you might need.

### The Setup

For a React based blog you just need a single package, `@lyket/react` and you are ready to start adding claps to your website.&#x20;

Next you need to signup for your Lyket account which can be found at [https://lyket.dev](https://lyket.dev) . Once you signed up grab the `Public API token`  from the dashboard.
