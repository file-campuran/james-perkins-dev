  Onboarding on an application, developer tool can be the success or death of
  your product.

Onboarding a new user, development team or customer is the success or death of your product. A great onboarding experience will encourage users to continue to use your product, potentially tell others when asked and grow the "superfans". A poor onboarding experience does the opposite, sort of, people who have a poor onboarding experience will tell others and won't need to be asked, many will give up and move on and some will tell you.

I suppose it is time to talk about what makes a good onboarding experience and more importantly where companies, open source projects and startups fall flat.
