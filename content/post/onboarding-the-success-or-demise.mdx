  Onboarding on an application, developer tool can be the success or death of
  your product.
---

In recent days I have been working on the long awaited re-write of Roll Your Tweet, I put out an MVP using developer tools, or tech, that had fit into a small subset of requirements.&#x20;

Then recently one of my favorite auth providers (shout out to Clerk) I finally got support for SSR. Alongside that I wanted to shift my database to Prisma and PlanetScale. This was the perfect time to move everything over and start the rewrite plus add some features I had been “holding off on”.

This means I have spent a lot of time onboarding with new providers, and as a developer experience / developer advocate I look at these from different light. Here are some thoughts.
