I am a huge advocate of minimalist websites, I don't hate heavily overly designed websites with animations and designs but they have a place. Talking of animations, one thing you do want is a way to handle moving between pages and loading data.&#x20;


Handling loading through next/router&#x20;
------------------------------------------

One great feature of `next``/router` is the ability to tap into the events that happen during a route change. This means you can use these to handle loading. So what are the events we need? We need route change events&#x20;

```javascript
routeChangeStart
routeChangeComplete
routeChangeError
```

With these three events and `useEffect` and `useState` you can handle each route change on your application. For example

```javascript
function Loading() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
      const handleStart = (url) => (url !== router.asPath) && setLoading(true);
      const handleComplete = (url) => (url === router.asPath) && setTimeout(() =>{setLoading(false)},2000);

      router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleStart)
      router.events.on('routeChangeComplete', handleComplete)
      router.events.on('routeChangeError',  handleComplete)

      return () => {
          router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleStart)
          router.events.off('routeChangeComplete', handleComplete)
          router.events.off('routeChangeError', handleComplete)
      }
  })
  
  return loading && (
  
}
```
